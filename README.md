# BillBot
HCDE 310 final project

This project aims to build a program that automatically writes Wikipedia article for US Congressional bills. The program is built for a very specific audience: English Wikipedia editors hoping to further expand the collection of entries on current and historical US legislations. At the current stage, the program searches for a specific piece of legislation by its bill id (e.g. hr502-116) and uses data collected from the ProPublica Congress API to produce a Wikipedia article in Wikitext format, which the user can directly copy and paste into Wikipediaâ€™s editing page and create the new article.

The program is currently hosted at https://billbot-310.appspot.com/
